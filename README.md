# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step 1:
Start by importing the required NumPy library.

Step 2:
Define the given matrix as a NumPy array.

Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.

Step 4:
Print the result to display the rank of the matrix.
## Program:
```
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: JAI HARISH R
#RegisterNumber:212224040124
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[5,-3,-10],[2,2,-3],[-3,-1,5]])
result=np.lina
lg.matrix_rank(A)
print(result)
```
## Output:
![{F8AA22FA-C92D-4B71-BAC5-6D4A7F217B71}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84461872-38ef-49ca-bcf1-d0238fb78fd1)

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
